# Django
Simple Django Website

This site was built to demonstrate basic knowledge of:

>The Python/Django web framework
>JavaScript, HTML, CSS
>CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) from SQLite3
>Display only user information
>Display Graphical Representations of CSV Data File

Further development of this site would allow user connection to other API's in order to perform research tasks. Backend data manipulation is also a feature of this site that I would like to work on in the future.
